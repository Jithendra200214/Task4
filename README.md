## Task 4: Aggregate Functions and Grouping

### Objective
Use aggregate functions and grouping to summarize and analyze data in the e-commerce database.

### What I Did
- Applied aggregate functions:
  - `SUM` → calculated total revenue and product sales.
  - `AVG` → found average order quantities.
  - `MAX` and `MIN` → identified highest purchase price and lowest product cost.
  - `COUNT` → counted total number of orders.
- Used `GROUP BY` to summarize sales per product.
- Combined `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to identify the top-selling product.

### Outcome
- Learned how to apply aggregate functions on numeric columns.
- Gained experience in summarizing tabular data using `GROUP BY`.
- Understood how to filter and rank results with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`.
